This folder contains the overleaf zip folder. To edit the pdf I sent you, please download this zip folder (It'll be easier if you just clone the entire repo and then as and when you need to do something, you can just drag and drop.) and open overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/). After logging in, Click **New Project** and select **Upload Project** from the drop-down that appears. You can then drag and drop the zip file. This will allow you to edit everything and note that the zip file contains all the images and everything so you're sorted out. Thank you!
